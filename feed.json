It's like those ice princess toon that is being shoved into girls throats left and right. The creators had way too much marketing money and decided: WE WILL FORCE THE PEOPLE TO LIKE IT. The ice princess and zombies are both just stupid characters. Compare that to the batman's joker, be it in gotham or one of the movies. Now there went some work in it. But zombies.... There are hardly any games without zombies which might be the reason why people are buying that uncreative shit, might be the reason they have to pile them up because one zombie would be too obviously bland.<br><br>TL/DR: Zombies are not elaboratively crafted compared to even the simplest enemy in non-zombie games. Also, nobody asked for zombies, but as there is a lack of games, people started playing zombie games. Which made developers think people liked it.</p>",
